floats - internal representation

a = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
b = 0.3
a == b -> False

format(a,'.25f')
format(b,'.25f')

some decimal numbers(with a finite representation) cannot be represented with a finite binary representation.
this can lead to some "weirdness" and bugs in our code (but not a python bug!)

floats - equality testing
(1) not use a ==b, use math.isclose(a,b,rel_tol=1e-5,abs_tol=1e-5)
(2) or use fraction if you want number to be exact
(3) use decimals

#what is isclose():
isclose(a,b,rel_tolerance,abs_tolerance)
use both relative tolerance and absolute tolerance
small numbers (close to 0): absolute tolerance
big numbers: relative tolerance
rounding is only using absolute tolerance, therefore cannot handle big numbers sometimes
# what is relative tolerance:
rel_tol = value	Optional. The relative tolerance. It is the maximum allowed difference between value a and b. Default value is 1e-09
# what is absolute tolerance:
abs_tol = value	Optional. The minimum absolute tolerance. It is used to compare values near 0. The value must be at least 0
