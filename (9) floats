floats - internal representation

a = 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1
b = 0.3
a == b -> False

format(a,'.25f')
format(b,'.25f')

some decimal numbers(with a finite representation) cannot be represented with a finite binary representation.
this can lead to some "weirdness" and bugs in our code (but not a python bug!)

floats - equality testing
(1) not use a ==b, use math.isclose(a,b,rel_tol=1e-5,abs_tol=1e-5)
(2) or use fraction if you want number to be exact
(3) use decimals
