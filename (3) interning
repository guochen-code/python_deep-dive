interning: reusing objects on-demand

at startup (when your program starts running.In the case of something like Jupyter, that's when the kernel for the notebook starts up.), 
python(cpython), pre-loads (caches) a global list of integers in the range [-5,256]
any time an integer is referenced in that range, python will use the cached version of that object

optimization strategy - small integers show up often

example:
when we write a = 10, python just has to point to the existing reference for 10
when we write a = 257, python does not use that global list and a new object is created every time

check which python you use:
import platform
print(platform.python_implementation())

I get CPython, but other possible values might be PyPy, IronPython, Jython, etc.

*** [-5,256] they are singleton collection.
