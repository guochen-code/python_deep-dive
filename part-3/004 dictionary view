(1) keys only                             ---- d.keys()
(2) values only                           ---- d.values()
(3) key/value pairs -> (key,value)        ---- d.items()

important:
order of keys and values and items are the same
the position of an item in one view corresponds to the same position in other views
python 3.6+: in addition, this order is same as dictionary insertion order

these views are dynamic


set operation
- union : s1 | s2
- intersection : s1 & s2
- difference : s1 - s2 # element in s1 but not in s2

dictionaries are now considered ordered (insertion order)
sets are not ordered

d1.keys() and d2.keys() are ordered
but d1.keys() | d2.keys is a set -> ordering of result is not guaranteed
