it is a view of dictionary. It can be really handy in some situations where you want to make sure somebody cannot modify your dictionary directly.
instead of returning a dictionary of making a copy of it, just return a mapping proxy of that dictionary.

from types import MappingProxyType

d = {'a':1,'b':2}

mp = MappingProxyType(d)
