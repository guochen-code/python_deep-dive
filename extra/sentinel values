problem statement:
def validate(a=None):
  if a is not None:
    print('argument was provided')
  else:
  print('argument was NOT provide')
  
valdate() -> argument was NOT provided
validate(10) -> argument was provided
validate(a=None) -> argument was NOT provided

# we can not differentiate if we pass None or not.

solution:
_sentinel=object()
def validate(a=None):
  if a is not _sentinel:
    print('argument was provided')
  else:
  print('argument was NOT provide')
  
we cannot do:
def validate(a=object()):
  if a is not object():
    print('argument was provided')
  else:
  print('argument was NOT provide')
  
solution:
def validate(a=object()):
  default_a = validate.__defaults__[0]
  if a is not default_a:
    print('argument was provided')
  else:
  print('argument was NOT provide')
  
extension:
def validate(a=object(),b=object(),*,kw=object()):
  default_a = validate.__defaults__[0]
  default_b = validate.__defaults__[1]
  default_kw = validate.__kwdefaults__['kw']
