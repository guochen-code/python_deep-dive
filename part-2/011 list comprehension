list comprehensions

goal: generate a list by transoforming, and optionally filtering another iterable

- start with some iterable
- create empty new list
- iterate over the original iterable
- skip over certain values (filter)
- transform value and append to new list

create a list of squares of all the integers between 1 and 100 that are not divisible by 2,3,or5
sq = [i**2 for i in range(1,101) if i%2 and i%3 and i%5] # boolean, 0 is False, others are True

******************************************* nested loops in comprehensions
l=[]
for i in range(5):
 for j in range(5):
  for k in range(5):
    l.append((i,j,k))
    
l = [(i,j,k) for i in range(5) for j in range(5) for k in range*5)]
note that the order in which the for loops are specified in the comprehension correspond to the order of the nested loops
