final approach
weakref.ref -> callback functionality
            -> automatically calls a custom function when the object is being finalized
-> use regular data dictionary
  -> use id(instance) as key
  -> use (weak_ref, value) as corresponding dictionary value
      -> for each weak_ref register a callback function
      -> callback function will removed dead entry from dictionary
we can now implement data descriptors that:
    -> have instance specific storage
    -> do not use the instance itself for storage(__slots__problem)
    -> handle non-hashable objects
    -> keep the data storage mechanism clean
